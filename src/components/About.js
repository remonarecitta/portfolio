                        <p>I am a 27 year old front-end engineer with 5 years of experience building high-performance, user-centric web applications.<br/>
                        I thrive in collaborative environments where technology meets design.

Beyond coding, I enjoy movies, art, and fitness, and indulge in plenty of hobbies, bringing creativity into different aspects of my life.
