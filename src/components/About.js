                        <p>I am a front-end engineer with 5 years of experience building high-performance, user-centric web applications. Specializing in React, TypeScript, and Redux, 
                        I thrive in collaborative environments where technology meets design. 
                        As I continue strengthening my expertise, I am also working toward a leadership role in front-end development, driving both technical excellence and team growth.

Beyond coding, I enjoy movies, art, and fitness, and indulge in plenty of hobbies, bringing creativity into different aspects of my life.

Let‚Äôs connect and discuss all things front-end, product, and technology!</p>
